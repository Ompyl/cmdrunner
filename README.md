cmdrunner minigame !!!NOT FROM ME!!!

Btw I know that the music is crap but the game is fun. This guy made it: https://www.dostips.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=7225
Download his version from: http://www.mediafire.com/file/wj9p99po9tj92tz/cmdrunner.zip/file

If u have problems with the grapics try to use conhost because the minigame doesn't work with the new terminal.
Open your Termianl and enter this command: chonhst.exe "cmdrunner.bat"

I hope you have fun!
